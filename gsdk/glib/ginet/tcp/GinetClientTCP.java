/**
 * GinetClientTCP -
 *
 * A thread-friendly, no-bloat, event-driven, and asynchronous TCP client
 * for Game Immediate mode Networking (Ginet) that is designed to be
 * easy and simple to use. The client establishes a connection to a server,
 * manages communication, and handles various events such as connection,
 * disconnection, data reception, and exceptions.<br>
 *
 * Key Features:<br>
 * - Thread-friendly: Utilizes a separate thread for handling the connection and data reception.<br>
 * - No-bloat: Designed with minimal and essential features for efficient communication.<br>
 * - Event-driven: Uses an event handler to manage different events such as connection, disconnection, data reception, and exceptions.<br>
 * - Asynchronous: The client connects and communicates with the server asynchronously.<br>
 * - Easy and simple: Provides straightforward methods for connecting, sending data, and emitting events.<br><br>
 *
 * The GinetClientTCP class allows you to:<br>
 * - Initialize the client with server host, port, and connection timeout.<br>
 * - Connect to the server and manage the connection state.<br>
 * - Send data to the server and emit custom events.<br>
 * - Handle different events through the GinetClientEventsTCP interface.<br>
 * - Soft handling of critical situations.<br><br>
 *
 * The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite.
 * It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol (IP).
 * Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP.
 * TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network.
 * Major internet applications such as the World Wide Web, email, remote administration, and file transfer rely on TCP, which is part of the Transport layer of the TCP/IP suite.
 * SSL/TLS often runs on top of TCP.
 *
 * TCP is connection-oriented, meaning that sender and receiver firstly need to establish a connection based on agreed parameters;
 * they do this through three-way handshake procedure. The server must be listening (passive open) for connection requests from clients before a connection is established.
 * Three-way handshake (active open), retransmission, and error detection adds to reliability but lengthens latency.
 * Applications that do not require reliable data stream service may use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) instead, which provides a connectionless datagram service that prioritizes time over reliability.
 * TCP employs network congestion avoidance. However, there are vulnerabilities in TCP, including denial of service, connection hijacking, TCP veto, and reset attack.
